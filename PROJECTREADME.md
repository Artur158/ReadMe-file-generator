Professional README Generator
Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application built with ES6 and Node.js that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on user input. When creating an open-source project on GitHub, having a high-quality README is essential for informing potential contributors and users about the project's purpose, usage, installation instructions, and more. This application streamlines the process of creating a README file, allowing project creators to focus more on developing their projects.
